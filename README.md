# Multiply and Sum Arrays

Please clone this repo, and complete the following warmup:

In this warmup, students build two functions

1. A function that multiplies two numerical values together
2. A function that aggregates the values of two arrays by summing them.
   > A level up option is provided for students to write functions that broadcast arrays

Tests have been provided to stress test each function's speed and durability.

Good luck!

# Don't mess it up!
